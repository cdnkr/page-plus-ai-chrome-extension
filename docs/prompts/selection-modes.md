I want to implement a new selection mode. The new selection mode is a drag box selection. When this mode is active, the user will be able to drag anywhere on the current page to create a box with a dashed outline. After drawing, they will be able to exend any side of it. There will be action buttons similar to the text selection action buttons. On the text selection, these show at the point of the mouse up. On the drag box these will show below the bottom right corner of the box. The options for the drag box selection will be Prompt and Colors. Prompt will be similar to the Prompt on the text selection - the difference is that the image will be used as the prompt input along with the users prompt about it on the prompt popover. Colors will get the 6 most prominent colors in the image and show them also on a popover with the option to copy each of them.

Text/Drag Box mode selection will be on bottom left of the page unobtrusive, minimal, icon only small circular buttons. These modes are: Text selection and drag box selection. Use these icons for each mode:
Text: <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-type-icon lucide-type"><path d="M12 4v16"/><path d="M4 7V5a1 1 0 0 1 1-1h14a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v2"/><path d="M9 20h6"/></svg>
Drag Box: <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-type-icon lucide-type"><path d="M12 4v16"/><path d="M4 7V5a1 1 0 0 1 1-1h14a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v2"/><path d="M9 20h6"/></svg>

Text select is the current functionality of the project the difference is that *now, by default it wonâ€™t be active only when this mode is on*.
Drag selection, when active allows the user to drag a selection box on the web page. There will be prompt and colors action buttons. Prompt loads the selection box as a screenshot to be queried by googles prompt api. Colors alayzes and gets the 6 most prominent colors of the image screenshot.
