        <h1>The Future of Artificial Intelligence in Web Development</h1>
        
        <p>Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing the way we build and interact with web applications. From automated code generation to intelligent user interfaces, AI is becoming an integral part of modern web development.</p>
        
        <h2>Current Applications</h2>
        
        <p>Today's web developers are already leveraging AI in numerous ways. <span class="highlight">Machine learning models</span> are being used to personalize user experiences, optimize content delivery, and automate routine development tasks. Natural language processing enables chatbots and virtual assistants that can understand and respond to user queries in real-time.</p>
        
        <p>Code generation tools powered by AI are helping developers write boilerplate code, implement common patterns, and even debug complex issues. These tools can analyze existing codebases, understand context, and suggest improvements or generate new functionality.</p>
        
        <h2>Emerging Technologies</h2>
        
        <p>The integration of <span class="highlight">large language models</span> into web browsers opens up new possibilities for client-side AI applications. Developers can now build applications that process natural language, generate content, and perform complex reasoning tasks entirely within the browser, without sending data to external servers.</p>
        
        <p>This shift towards on-device AI processing addresses privacy concerns while enabling new types of interactive applications. Users can benefit from AI-powered features without compromising their data privacy, as all processing happens locally on their device.</p>
        
        <h2>Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
        
        <p>While the potential is enormous, there are significant challenges to overcome. <span class="highlight">Performance optimization</span> is crucial, as AI models can be computationally intensive. Developers must balance model complexity with browser performance constraints.</p>
        
        <p>Accessibility and user experience design become more important as AI features become more sophisticated. Developers need to ensure that AI-powered interfaces remain intuitive and don't create barriers for users with different technical backgrounds.</p>
        
        <h2>Future Outlook</h2>
        
        <p>The future of web development with AI looks promising. We can expect to see more sophisticated development tools, more intelligent user interfaces, and new paradigms for human-computer interaction. The key will be finding the right balance between automation and human creativity.</p>
        
        <p>As these technologies mature, web developers will need to adapt their skills and workflows. Understanding AI capabilities and limitations will become as important as understanding traditional web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <h1>Technical Specifications</h1>
        
        <p>For developers interested in implementing AI features in web applications, here are some key technical considerations:</p>
        
        <h2>Browser Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chrome 138+ for Summarizer API</li>
            <li>Chrome 137-142 for Writer API (origin trial)</li>
            <li>Modern JavaScript support (ES2018+)</li>
            <li>WebAssembly support for model execution</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Hardware Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimum 16GB RAM for CPU inference</li>
            <li>4GB+ VRAM for GPU acceleration</li>
            <li>22GB+ free storage for model downloads</li>
            <li>Unmetered internet connection for initial setup</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>API Integration</h2>
        <p>The new browser APIs provide several key capabilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prompt API:</strong> Natural language processing and generation</li>
            <li><strong>Summarizer API:</strong> Content summarization with multiple formats</li>
            <li><strong>Writer API:</strong> Content generation and writing assistance</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These APIs enable developers to build sophisticated AI-powered applications without the complexity of managing external AI services or handling sensitive data transmission.</p>
